                        I write code (good?) and make jokes (bad?). As a programmer who loves to sketch and paint, I like
                        blending functionality with creativity, but also care about optimization and scalability. I have
                        worked on building gameplay mechanics, enemy AI, and game systems for 2D, 3D and
                        VR games in Unity and Unreal engines. I have participated in team based game jams such as GMTK, Boston GGJ, and also worked on solo
                        projects as well throughout my Masters program at Northeastern University. I am usually building
                        games or playing them as I am always looking to expand my knowledge of different genres and
                        understanding their learning curves. I am always up for a challenge and keep an optimistic outlook.
