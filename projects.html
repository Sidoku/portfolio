                    This 2D platformer is heavily inspired by Celeste , SpeedRunners: the Game, and 2D Sonic the
                    Hedgehog. The player will spend most of the time “sight-reading” levels as obstacles appear in their
                    way. Moving quickly and smoothly is the core experience. The game story follows a Yo-Yo's journey
                    after it had been left behind accidentally by the child that owns it. The child has left for school
                    and the Yo-Yo must navigate the world in the fastest possible time to return to its favourite human
                    as a Yo-Yo always does.

                <p>
                    The grapple is the primary mechanic and everything else is built and implemented to support that
                    mechanic. Mechanics are listed below in order of complexity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Move roll:</strong>
                        Players generate velocity slowly, like a car, and moving in the other direction means you must
                        first overcome the initial velocity. There is no max speed, and it continuously adds speed to
                        the player, even while in the air. This should feel slow at first, but level design indicates we
                        start each level with some velocity through gravity (start the player higher than the ground).
                        Slowing down is a punishment for the player.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Jump/Double Jump:</strong>
                        Players can jump once on the ground and jump again while in air. It resets upon touching the
                        ground. Jumping in air resets downward velocity to zero before adding the upwards jump velocity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dash:</strong>
                        The dash starts with Celeste’s dash as an example, except it only adds a fixed amount of speed
                        in the direction the player indicates. The dash resets upon touching the ground.
                        Can be used by player to gain a burst of speed after stopping/slowing down
                        Enables quickly changing direction in the air
                        Utilized to maximize the acceleration of the player (spamming it whenever it is available)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Grapple:</strong>
                        Players can grapple to specific yellow points on the map when they are within the radius ( 4
                        units ). When within that radius, an animation plays with a button prompt for the player to
                        grapple to it. Players accelerate when grappling. Grapple has no recharge or reset – provided
                        you are in range, you may grapple.
                    </li>
