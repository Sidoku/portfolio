                    This capstone project focuses on the design and implementation of a multiplayer game based on bounty
                    hunting that incorporates both cooperative and competitive mechanics. The game features four
                    players, with two playing as Bounty Hunters and the other two playing as Criminals. The objective of
                    the game is to either capture or evade the opposing team while utilizing various game mechanics,
                    such as combat and movement to ensure individual success.

                    The game includes explicit collaboration and betrayal mechanics, where players can choose to reveal
                    the location of their own teammate to the opposing team. These mechanics are designed to test the
                    prisoner's dilemma and to evaluate the impact of non-uniform decision-making on player behavior.

                    The project involves iterative design and testing to ensure a balance between cooperation and
                    competition, providing an engaging and exciting gameplay experience for players. The game's success
                    will be evaluated based on player feedback and gameplay metrics. Overall, the game is designed to
                    provide a unique and memorable gaming experience that challenges players to balance individual
                    success with the need for cooperation.

                    The grapple is the primary mechanic and everything else is built and implemented to support that
                    mechanic. Mechanics are listed below in order of complexity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Move roll:</strong>
                        Players generate velocity slowly, like a car, and moving in the other direction means you must
                        first overcome the initial velocity. There is no max speed, and it continuously adds speed to
                        the player, even while in the air. This should feel slow at first, but level design indicates we
                        start each level with some velocity through gravity (start the player higher than the ground).
                        Slowing down is a punishment for the player.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Jump/Double Jump:</strong>
                        Players can jump once on the ground and jump again while in air. It resets upon touching the
                        ground. Jumping in air resets downward velocity to zero before adding the upwards jump velocity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dash:</strong>
                        The dash starts with Celeste’s dash as an example, except it only adds a fixed amount of speed
                        in the direction the player indicates. The dash resets upon touching the ground.
                        Can be used by player to gain a burst of speed after stopping/slowing down
                        Enables quickly changing direction in the air
                        Utilized to maximize the acceleration of the player (spamming it whenever it is available)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Grapple:</strong>
                        Players can grapple to specific yellow points on the map when they are within the radius ( 4
                        units ). When within that radius, an animation plays with a button prompt for the player to
                        grapple to it. Players accelerate when grappling. Grapple has no recharge or reset – provided
                        you are in range, you may grapple.

                    The team created asymmetric mechanics that leveraged the strengths of each platform and balanced the gameplay so that both players had a meaningful role to play in solving puzzles and progressing through the game.

                    The team analyzed successful cooperative games and used design patterns to create challenges that required players to communicate, collaborate, and learn from each other in order to succeed.
